## Who am I?
Hello! My name is Sebastian Llauce Bautista, and here's my story:

<font color = "#17f3ce">I started coding out of sheer curiosity at the **age of 15**.</font>

*"Wait, isn't that too late?"*

<font color = "#87fe29">I may have gotten a late start, but that doesn't stop me from learning as much I can about programming.</font>

<font color = "#17c4f3">It wasn't until a year ago, at the age of 17, that I realized engineering was my passion.</font>

Thus, programming is now much more than a hobby to me, and I am glad to showcase some of my humble projects, including:
- Learning to use APIs
- Trying out many python files
- Creating little practice files
- Developing a personal database
