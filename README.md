# Personal-Portfolio
Hello! My name is Sebastian Llauce Bautista.
This is my personal portfolio. I hope you both are both enjoyed and intrigued by what you see.

I started coding out of sheer curiosity at the age of 15. Although many might think that by 
then it was too late, I've been working really hard to catch up. 
It wasn't until a year ago, at the age of 17, that I realized that I would commit my entire life
towards engineering. Thus, programming is now much more than a hobby to me, and I am glad to 
share with you these little advancements I've done until now.

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase some of my personal projects, both big and small,
complex or simple, in hopes of showing how progress is a compilation of small steps taken towards
bigger goal. Thank you for your time.
